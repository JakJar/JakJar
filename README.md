### Hi there 👋

My name is Jakub and I am a Junior Fullstack Developer .Net + React

From childhood I love DIY, creating and improving.</br>
Finding solutions for a problem gives me great satisfaction.</br>
Programming for me is a perfect way to do what I truly love anytime and anywhere! ❤️

Feel free to contact with me 😄.
